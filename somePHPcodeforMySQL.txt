Very important that the ` is the top left key on keyboard.
If use the ' (which is on right hand side with @, the SELECT doesn't work.
Only use around table names NOT when refering to a table.column  ! 
(The error message will say "Unknown column in field list"

ALTER TABLE `tasksstages` CHANGE `StageDate` `StageDate` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL;


getting last ID source w3 (not what the manual says)

if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    $last_id = $conn->insert_id;
    echo "New record created successfully. Last inserted ID is: " . $last_id;
  } else {
    echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error;
  }


SELECT * FROM `tasksstages` LIMIT 4 OFFSET 3;
$sql = "SELECT * FROM `tasksstages` LIMIT 4 OFFSET 3;";


get all of tasks & StageDesc

SELECT * FROM `tasksheader` CROSS JOIN `tasksstages`; //but this gave 55 rows when there are only 8 + 8 =16 total rows

$sql = "SELECT * FROM `tasksheader` CROSS JOIN `tasksstages`;";

use two calls?
$sql = "SELECT * FROM `tasksheader`";

$sql = "SELECT * FROM `tasksstages`;"





Students (all) with id + names + task & name + stage + manager & name

SELECT tasklist.TLId, tasklist.TaskId, tasksheader.TaskName, tasklist.Stage, tasklist.StudentId, membersSt.MUserName AS StudentName, tasklist.ManagerId, membersMan.MUserName AS ManagerName 
FROM `tasklist`
INNER JOIN tasksheader ON tasklist.TaskId=tasksheader.THId
INNER JOIN members AS membersSt ON tasklist.StudentId=membersSt.MId 
INNER JOIN members AS membersMan ON tasklist.ManagerId=membersMan.MId;

$sql = "SELECT tasklist.TLId, tasklist.TaskId, tasksheader.TaskName, tasklist.Stage, tasklist.StudentId, membersSt.MUserName AS StudentName, tasklist.ManagerId, membersMan.MUserName AS ManagerName \n"
    . "FROM `tasklist`\n"
    . "INNER JOIN tasksheader ON tasklist.TaskId=tasksheader.THId\n"
    . "INNER JOIN members AS membersSt ON tasklist.StudentId=membersSt.MId \n"
    . "INNER JOIN members AS membersMan ON tasklist.ManagerId=membersMan.MId;";






count of all tables & unique students & managers

finally got something working aI & I (neither did it alone)


$sql = "SELECT\n"

    . "  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT MId) FROM members) AS countMembers,\n"

    . "  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT THId) FROM tasksheader) AS countTasksheaders,\n"

    . "  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT TSId) FROM tasksStages) AS countTasksStages,\n"

    . "  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT TLId) FROM taskList) AS countTaskList,\n"

    . "  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT studentId) FROM taskList) AS countStudents,\n"

    . "  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT TaskAuthor) FROM tasksheader) AS countAuthors,\n"

    . "  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT managerId) FROM taskList) AS countManagers;";

The above produces single associative array that works.
