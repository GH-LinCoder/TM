      <h2>Managing a voluntary group with tasks to complete</h2><br>
      <h4>A database driven website, under your control, to manage a group of members with a simplified tracking of tasks to complete or lessons to study. 
       <p> Progress can be checked as each student completes stages of the task or lesson.</p>
<p>Members can self-select to tackle tasks or lessons or can be assigned by managers.</p>
<p>New tasks or lessons can be created with steps or stages.</p>

    <p><h2>Begin with the Summary</h2></p>
    <p>This shows how many members there are. Those members who are on a course or a task are called Students, the members who are helping them are called managers. The members who created the tasks are called Authors. Below that section are the tasks, their stages & how many have students assigned to those courses or tasks.</p>
    <p>Any of those sections can be clicked to see the details</p>
    <p>The menu at the top will also show the details & open a page with actions that relate to those sections.</p>

      <p>Clicking any row of the table will open a card display of that row of information</p>
      <p>In the card display there are navigation buttons <b>previous</b> and <b>next</b> to change which item is displayed, but the new item is only displayed after you click the displayed number to confirm the change. <i>

      <h4><strong>The lower part of the summary</strong> lists the task definitions, the stages that each task has & the tasks which have been assigned. 
       <p> The tasklist shows who has been assigned to tasks as a student or manager. It also shows how far the student has moved through the stages of the task.</p>
      <p>The information about tasks consists of a 'header' which shows 
        <lu>
          <li>the name of the task</li>
          <li>a brief description </li>
          <li>the date created</li> 
          <li>& the person who created it (the author).</li>
        </lu></p>
    <p>The stages are the individual steps that the task entails. Students' progress through these stages can be monitored in the tasklist.</p>

      <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Clicking any menu item (task, stages, tasklist) will display a page from the database. This appears on a table that opens automatically.</p>

        <p><strong>Create Task</strong></p>
        <p>Creating tasks requires a 'taskheader' which names  and describes the task. Then the stages of the task have to be named , numbered & defined. These are the steps a student has to go through to complete the task.</p>
        <p><i>Note: the headers and stages are descriptions of the task. The task itself may be physical outside the computer or may be a series of videos separate from the Task & Member system. </i></p>

The tasks could be training in how to use Task & Member. They could be learning about data protection law, or bookkeeping or how to care for bees...</p>
<p><i>Note: The task system is not designed as a to-do list. It is for the kind of task that will be tackled by many people over time, rather than something that needs to be done once.</i></p>

  <h4>There are two hidden display panels which can be opened or closed using the buttons on the screen.
    <p>There is a table display for showing multiple rows of data from the database. This is the 'List View'.</p>
  <p>There is a way to display a single item on its own. This is the card view. When using card view there is usually a way to click to the next or previous item which is then displayed on its own.</p>
  <p>TYhe list view has active rows, which if clciked will open the card view and display that row of information on its own. You can move to the next item by clicking the buttons on the card view or by clicking another row in the table.</p>
  <p>The table only displays a limited number of rows. This is called a page of data. The page can be changed by clicking the table navigation buttons. These can jump 100s of pages at a time.</p>
