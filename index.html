      <h2>Managing a voluntary group with tasks to complete</h2><br>
      <h4>A database driven website, under your control, to manage a group of members with a simplified tracking of tasks to complete or lessons to study. 
       <p> Progress can be checked as each student completes stages of the task or lesson.</p>
<p>Members can self-select to tackle tasks or lessons or can be assigned by managers.</p>
<p>New tasks or lessons can be created with steps or stages.</p>

    <p><h2>Begin with the Summary</h2></p>
    <p>This shows how many members there are. Those members who are on a course or a task are called Students, the members who are helping them are called managers. The members who created the tasks are called Authors. Below that section are the tasks, their stages & how many have students assigned to those courses or tasks.</p>
    <p>Any of those sections can be clicked to see the details</p>
    <p>The menu at the top will also show the details & open a page with actions that relate to those sections.</p>

      <p>In the card display there are navigation buttons <b>previous</b> and <b>next</b> to change which item is displayed, but the new item is only displayed after you click the displayed number to confirm the change. <i>

       <p> The tasklist shows who has been assigned to tasks as a student or manager. It also shows how far the student has moved through the stages of the task.</p>
      <p>The information about tasks consists of a 'header' which shows

    <p>The stages are the individual steps that the task entails. Students' progress through these stages can be monitored in the tasklist.</p>

        <p><strong>Create Task</strong></p>
        <p>Creating tasks requires a 'taskheader' which names  and describes the task. Then the stages of the task have to be named , numbered & defined. These are the steps a student has to go through to complete the task.</p>
        <p><i>Note: the headers and stages are descriptions of the task. The task itself may be physical outside the computer or may be a series of videos separate from the Task & Member system. </i></p>

        <p><strong>Cards</strong></p>
        <p>Click a row of a list and the data will be displayed on its own in a card. In this example the card is diplaying an assigned task.
          On the left with the large dark blue panel is the tasklist reference number.(TLId tasklist identification), then the task reference number (TaskId), 
          the stage that the student has reached (stage 2), the student's user name (Brisia) and the refernce number and name of the member managing this task (1 FirstRides).
          <p>
          To the right is the navigation box which says the diaply is item 2. This is also displayed in the large green box idicating that the record is actually number 2.
          above the green box is the previous button, and below the box is the next button. Clicking either will increase or decrease the number in the box, the box will turn white as you change the number. 
          The data will only be updated when you left click the number box. <i>The box is green only when the displayed data reference matches the number displayed in the box</i>  
          </p>
          

          It is possible to click through to other rows either by clicking the list or by clicking the card navigation buttons. 
          The number displayed in the large box increases with <b>Next</b> and decreases with <b>Previous</b>, 
          but the displayed card only changes when you click that displayed number.
         <i> If the databse doesn't have such a numbered row the display may jump to the next available row number. </i></p>

        <p><strong>The remember this button</strong></p>
        <p>Clicking the <b>remember this </b> button creates a new menu for you to tag the data & store it locally. </p>
        <p> This gives options for how to tag the data to remind you later.</p>
        <p>If you don't want to save the card data, click EXIT no save. The card will still be displayed.</p>
        <p>The normal use is to collect data to be able to then process it such as collecting a member card for the person who will be a student
          and then a task for that student & then another member who will manage the task. That would be as Student, as Task & as Manager.
          <i> However, it is also possible to save more than one item with the same tag. Each one will be saved separately.</i> </p>
          <p>This makes it possible to collect a number of students or managers or authors or tasks in a list.</p>
        <p>The data that is saved is also sent to the server so that it is kept & can be retrieved automatically if you go to another webpage.</p>
